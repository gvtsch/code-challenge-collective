# Code Challenge Collective
Welcome to the Code Challenge Collective! This GitHub repository is a platform where we can work together on various programming tasks, especially the Advent of Code tasks. Our goal is to improve our skills, learn new techniques and have fun programming together.

The repository "Code Challenge Collective" provides a structured environment for solving programming tasks. By sharing this repository, we can not only manage our own solutions, but also learn from each other by reviewing and discussing our colleagues' code.

How can colleagues submit their solutions?

1. Fork the repository: Each colleague can create a copy of the repository in their own GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page.
2. Create branch: Once the fork has been created, the colleague can create a new branch with a meaningful name for the specific task they want to work on.
3. Add solution: The colleague can add their solution in the corresponding branch. It is advisable to document the code well and add explanations if necessary to help other colleagues understand the approach.
4. Create pull request: Once the solution is ready and uploaded to their own fork, the colleague can create a pull request to push their changes back to the main repository. In the pull request description, the colleague can add a brief explanation of their solution and ask for feedback or support if necessary.
5. Code review and discussion: Other colleagues can review the pull request, provide feedback, make suggestions for improvement and ask questions. This creates an interactive learning environment in which we can learn from each other and improve our skills.

This structured approach allows us to work effectively on the programming tasks, learn from each other and improve our skills together. Have fun coding!

## Forks:

A fork is an exact copy of a repository that is stored in your own GitHub account. Forking a repository gives you your own copy that you can work with independently without affecting the original repository. This allows you to make changes without disturbing the work of others.

1. Create a fork: Go to the "Code Challenge Collective" repository page and click on the "Fork" button at the top right. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Working in your fork: Once you have created your fork, you can make changes, solve new tasks and upload your own code without affecting the original repository.

## Branches:

A branch is an isolated line of development that branches off from the main line of development (usually called main or master). This allows you to work independently on a specific task or feature without jeopardizing the stability of the main code.

1. Create a branch: After you have created your fork, create a new branch for the specific task you want to work on. You can do this via the command line with Git or directly via the GitHub user interface.
2. Work in the branch: Switch to the created branch and start solving the task. You can make any changes, add, edit and test your code without affecting the other tasks or the main code.
3. Upload changes: Once you are happy with your solution, upload your changes to your fork. This can be done by committing and pushing in the command line or by uploading the files directly via the GitHub user interface.
4. Create a pull request: After your changes have been uploaded to your fork, you can create a pull request to push your changes back to the main repository. Briefly describe your changes and the task solved.

By using forks and branches, you can work independently without interfering with the work of others, while still sharing your solutions with the main repository for review. Each colleague can solve any task in one or more programming languages, and the structure of the repository allows for diverse collaboration.
